## FUNCTIONALITIES:

1. Creating Accounts: Accounts are created because they allow users to store information and retain their data if they change devices. 

2. Integrating with Other Services: The best and most convenient way to register an account in an website is through social networks. With social logins, users can immediately see all their friends who use the same app and can start publishing their results on social media. Firstly, this increases motivation because people can see their friends’ progress. 

3. Adding Personal Info: The ability to add personal information is important because the diet or workout programs in your app must be set according to a user’s age, weight, height, and other physical parameters. Calculating workouts based on personal data makes the workouts more individual, and is always appreciated by people who are concerned with health issues.
